\section{Executive Summary}
\paragraph{} This document will briefly describe the real world issue we have been contracted by Charles Zeller and David Long of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane, Indiana to solve. More detailed design documentation will be added to this document as the design and development progress through all phases of the project.

\subsection*{Items Contained in this Document}
\paragraph{}This contains an Analysis of the current system including the problems that Charles Zeller and David Long have identified with the system. It will also contain background on Charles Zeller and David Long and why they need a new system designed. There will also be a list of features and their status in relation to the project, a high level description of the project and an analysis of the key stakeholders for the project. %Other types of documentation will also be included such as: use cases, supplementary requirements, performance requirements, usability requirements, supportability requirements, reliability requirements, integration specifications, legal requirements \& user interface designs. These supplementary requirements will give a better description of sections of the project that are not easily captured in a use case. They help to make sure that nothing is lost. Coding Standards and Requirements Change Procedures will help keep the code used in this project maintainable and the change procedures will make sure that the effects that a change may impose are considered before they are made.
