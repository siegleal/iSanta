\paragraph{} In order to achieve the quality attributes listed, we will utilize the following tactics:

\subsection{Usability}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Interface will follow Apple's interface guidelines
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{Reliability}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The application will run on any iPhone running iOS 5 or later and iPod Touch 4th generation or later. 
	\item The application will be available for download from the Apple App Store.
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{Performance}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Images will be analyzed using the same algorithms researched for previous iterations of the SANTA project
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{Modifiability}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Implementation will be done through object oriented programming practices.
	\item The system will be modeled after the Model-View-Controller pattern following standard iPhone development practices.  This will allow the interface and the backend algorithms to be easily modified independently of one an another.
	\end{itemize}
\subsection{Testability}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The accuracy of all statistics calculated will be tested using unit tests.
	\item The user interface will be tested using usability testing.
	\end{itemize}
