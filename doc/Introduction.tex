\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{} The Special Weapons Division at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane (NSWC Crane)$[1]$ is charged with testing and repairing weapons that are used by the United States Armed Forces. This requires the ability to quickly and accurately determine the reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) functions. Accuracy is accounted for by both the availability and maintainability of a weapon. The current system for determining these results for sub-sonic munitions has been made unusable through tighter regulations on the use of removable storage devices on government issued computer systems. Our system will circumvent these new restrictions by performing the same operations on an non-regulated device. The devices we will use are the iPod touch$[2]$ and the iPhone$[4]$
