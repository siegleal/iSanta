\subsection{Usability}
\paragraph{}\textsc{Source:} End User
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus:} Usability Test
\paragraph{}\textsc{Artifact:} System
\paragraph{}\textsc{Environment:} Normal Operating Conditions
\paragraph{}\textsc{Response:} User performs the requested task
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus Measure:} User performs the task successfully without requiring assistance

\paragraph{}\textsc{Source:} Environment
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus:} Apple iPhone Look and Feel
\paragraph{}\textsc{Artifact:} System
\paragraph{}\textsc{Environment:} Normal Operating Conditions
\paragraph{}\textsc{Response:} Application interface works in a similar manner to all iPhone apps
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus Measure:} Application following Apple's interface guidelines and meets App Store approval

\subsection{Reliability/Recovery}
\paragraph{}\textsc{Source:} Environment
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus:} The program becomes unresponsive or abruptly terminates while manipulating the image
\paragraph{}\textsc{Artifact:} System
\paragraph{}\textsc{Environment:} Normal Operating Conditions
\paragraph{}\textsc{Response:} After reopening the application the most recent changes are still applied
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus Measure:} The iPhone will be able to recover the last saved state of the app

\subsection{Performance}
\paragraph{}\textsc{Source:} End User
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus:} User selects for system to begin analyzing image
\paragraph{}\textsc{Artifact:} System
\paragraph{}\textsc{Environment:} Normal Operating Conditions
\paragraph{}\textsc{Response:} Image is analyzed and a list of points of bullet holes is presented.
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus Measure:} The entirety of the image processing should occur faster than the user could do it by hand (5-10 minutes).

\paragraph{}\textsc{Source:} End User
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus:} User selects for system to begin analyzing image
\paragraph{}\textsc{Artifact:} System
\paragraph{}\textsc{Environment:} Normal Operating Conditions
\paragraph{}\textsc{Response:} System calculates the spread
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus Measure:} Results are as accurate or more accurate then can be calculated by hand. Because we are using the same formulas our accuracy is dependent on the accuracy of the points which is user controlled.

\subsection{Modifiability}
\paragraph{}\textsc{Source:} Developer
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus:} Client Request
\paragraph{}\textsc{Artifact:} System
\paragraph{}\textsc{Environment:} Design
\paragraph{}\textsc{Response:} The change is made to the interface
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus Measure:} Purely cosmetic changes made to the interface must be able to be made only to the UI components of the system.

\paragraph{}\textsc{Source:} Developer
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus:} Update bullet hole detection algorithm
\paragraph{}\textsc{Artifact:} System
\paragraph{}\textsc{Environment:} Design
\paragraph{}\textsc{Response:} Algorithm modified
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus Measure:} Algorithm interface must be modular enough to allow for easy substitution or addition of open cv algorithms

\subsection{Testability}
\paragraph{}\textsc{Source:} Tester
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus:} Field Test
\paragraph{}\textsc{Artifact:} System
\paragraph{}\textsc{Environment:} Normal Operating Conditions
\paragraph{}\textsc{Response:} System produces results comparable to manual calculations
\paragraph{}\textsc{Stimulus Measure:} The system must compute the results faster than can be performed by hand (5-10min).

\subsection{Security}
