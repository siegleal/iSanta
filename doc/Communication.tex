\section{Communication}
\paragraph{} The teams main communication pathway will be through email. This will allow us to communicate even when we can not meet in person. Our tasks will be tracked using a Pivotal Tracker project located at \href{https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/372177}{www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/372177}. We will also be conducting weekly meetings with our project advisor, Shaun Bohner and weekly phone calls/scrum meetings with our clients, Charles Zeller and David Long.
\paragraph{} If needed we will add more meeting times to achieve better communication. We will continue to divide up work so that we minimize the time we spend sitting in meetings and improve our productivity.
