\paragraph{}The purpose of this document is to outline the architecture and framework which we plan to use to implement the Small Arms Naval Target Analyzer iOS app. It will show the different patterns and tactics we will use. It will also detail how the user and data will flow through the app. There are also screen shots to show what the user will be looking at when using the app. We have also included a video demo of the app in action, this is only viewable in the digital version of the document. This document is written as a living document and will change as we move forward in the project.
