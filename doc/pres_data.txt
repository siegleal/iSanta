==BACKGROUND

NSWC SWD
- Needs to be able to ana;yze targets in the field
- Want to increase the accuracy of analysis
	- By hand is not accurate enough due to the method

Want an iOS app for ease of use and large availability of hardware

We will use image recognition to identify bullet holes in the large target
- The app will normalize the image and approximate bullet holes
- The user can manually adjust impact placement after regocnition

==CLIENT OVERVIEW

Charles Zeller, Techincal Warrant Holder, Small Arms & Weapons Crane Division

David Long, Air, Land, Sea, and Expeditionary Systems Small Arms Project Manager Crane Division

Handle small arms testing at NSWC Crane (Where does this fit in?)

==CURRENT SYSTEM

Desktop system designed by Rose Senior Design Team 2-3 years ago
- Technicians don't like needing to go back to the office to see the results
- Cannot use USB devices (Cameras, SD card readers) anymore
- Using Rulers does not give results that are as accurate as desired

==TECHONOLOGIES USED

iOS 5
- Objective-C
- C++

CSV to get results into Excel-readable format

OpenCV for image regocnition
- (add more with Alex later)

==DESIGN ARCHITECTURE

Include Arch diagram (fix it)

MVC (Model View Controller)
-Driven by iOS standards

Engine System
- Large tasks in background not appropriate for MVC architecture
	- Normalization
	- Statistical Analysis
	- Excel-readable formatting and e-mail
